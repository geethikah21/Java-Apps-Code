I wrote a Dictionary program that translates words (given that theyâ€™re in the data files being read in the program) from English to Chinese (or vice versa). The data files have the terms, definitions, and pronunciations of the colors of the rainbow in English and Chinese. If the user inputs a color in English, the program will output the characters for that color in Chinese and give its pronunciation (known as pinyin). Users can also type in a sample sentence and the program will output the sentence with punctuation (the periods in English are different from those in Chinese, as periods in Chinese are open circles).
